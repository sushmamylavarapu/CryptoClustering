# CryptoClustering

CryptoClustering is a Python project that focuses on clustering cryptocurrencies based on market data. It utilizes techniques such as K-Means clustering and Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.

## Data
The project uses market data of cryptocurrencies, which can be sourced from various cryptocurrency exchanges. Ensure that you have a dataset with relevant features before running the code.

## Methods
The project employs two main techniques:

K-Means Clustering: This method partitions the data into k clusters based on similarity in feature space.

Principal Component Analysis (PCA): PCA is used for dimensionality reduction, allowing for visualization and improved clustering performance.

## Results
The project generates insights on how cryptocurrencies are grouped together based on market behavior. Visualizations and summary statistics are provided to aid in understanding the clustering outcomes.
